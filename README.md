I used the following AWS Services:

Amazon Lex: Built the chatbot and define conversation flow.

AWS Lambda: Get the book recommendation using a third party API.

AWS IAM: Ensure secure access by managing user permissions.

Amazon Translate: Used for translation of the sentence according to the input language specified.
